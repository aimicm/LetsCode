This project was used in the Android courses I have been involved. It's a "didactical" project with code examples of how to use some of the most used Android functionality as:

- Databases
- Preferences
- Services
- AsyncTask
- UI Examples 
- UI List Examples
- Custom UI Example
- Internal/External Storage
- Content Providers
and more!
